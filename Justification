I have done Prims and Kruskals in python language and Dijkstra in C programming language because these both languages are syntactically clean, 
so we can focus on what really matters - understanding the data structures and, more importantly, the algorithms which operate against them.
Languages take a secondary place as it is more important to understand the concepts rather than focusing more about the syntax.
